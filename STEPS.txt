E2E EXERCISE STEP RECORD FOR NOW

1. GO TO : https://hub.docker.com/_/jenkins?tab=description

pull the image from the official, non-deprecated image:

docker pull jenkins/jenkins | Link = https://hub.docker.com/r/jenkins/jenkins

2. In the documenation is says to run this line of code:

docker run -p 8080:8080 -p 50000:50000 -v C:/Users/John/Docker/E2E_Docker/Jenkins:/var/jenkins_home jenkins/jenkins

Store the data in the jenkins server to a volume on the host PC so it remains persistent

Port 8080 exposes the web interface
Port 50000 gives access to a remote Java (JIRA) API

3. Navigate to localhost:8080

This will take you to a login page, then you need to go inside the container and navigate to a file written inside: /var/jenkins_home/secrets/initialAdminPassword to login.

Enter that into the password box, continue and then proceed to install suggested plugins.

Username: admin
Password: admin
E-mail: jbyrne@spartaglobal.com

Go to Manage Jenkins> Plugin Manager > Search Docker and install > Docker

Gitbash: docker <name_of_container> restart
